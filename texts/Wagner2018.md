Wagner traces[^1], across aboriginal tribes, a shared concept he terms "reciprocity of perspectives," or "subject-object switch":

As they went on to explain, all social or cognitive concerns can be circumscribed within a realm of figure-ground reversal, and it is only from a point outside circularity that one can perceive the whole of it at once. "We call it *pire wuo*" they said—a term that means literally "the reciprocity of perspectives" or perhaps "the exchange of viewpoints." 

"Chiasmatic" is his term for a sublation-like (*aufheben*) relationship between concepts, perspectives which are partial and yet connected.

He theorizes in humans a "reflective self," with "everything we know," and an anticipatory self"—that which is "necessary for action" which proactively projects and wills its intention "beyond the confines of order or memory to unpredict the course of events that are about to happen." ([Reconciliations](https://www.notion.so/Reconciliations-f2613dcbde1d4891b63b82cf21796ff9): predictive processing & Bayesian brain hypothesis.)

### Examples of reciprocity of perspective in aboriginal epistemology

Perhaps the most influential rhetorical incorporation of perspectival reciprocity was recovered by Tânia Stolze Lima (1999) from the Tupinamba of eastern Brazil: when a peccary looks at a peccary, it sees a human being, but when it looks at a human being, it sees another peccary. A classic instance of chiasmatic figure–ground reversal, this elegant allusion to the perceptual subject/object shift has nothing whatever to do with how peccaries perceive things, but subverts its whole function as sucker bait for the literal minded. Called ‘the speech of remote intentions’ by the Daribi for that very reason, this mode of revealing secret knowledge by concealing it from the unwary – using what Shakespeare would have called a ‘conceit’ – is a diagnostic feature of chiasmatic expression.

### Ritual epistemology & self-alienation

Following Victor Turner and Heidegger, Wagner sees in the "anti-structures" of ritual a figure-ground transposition which enables a productive self-alienation ("defamiliarization," the tool "present-at-hand"):

ritual enacts what "cannot be thought of" [...] a ritual like a rite of passage must traverse the means to that end as though those means were an end in their own right; for without that transposition of ends and means the self-alienation of thought upon which knowledge depends could not take place.

The "enemy's point of view" (here he quotes Vivieros de Castro, 1992) provides the "required" self-alienation to get you "out" of one point of view—the subject's—and into the object, thus creating a relationship of reciprocal perspectives or "*tapabot*."

Humanity is a *tapabot*, a prime mediator between the active and the passive—the objective and the subjective: an entity of this sort does not *evolve*, but rather uses the idea of evolution itself as a sort of alibi for what it is *really* doing. 

This "really" that Wagner sees humanity as doing is, as I understand it, the reciprocity of perspectives—the self-alienation or inversion of an established view or truth such as to produce a more holistic perspective—a kind of dialectical sublation. This sublation or transposition of subject and object is a "metaphorical" placing of things in relation to one another—and here "each term of the metaphor, the tenor and the vehicle, serves as *both* signifier and signified in relation to the other.... a metaphor has no subject because it is basically a subject/object shift." He appears to be arguing, like [Hofstadter 2001: Analogy As The Core of Cognition](https://www.notion.so/Hofstadter-2001-Analogy-As-The-Core-of-Cognition-ab4d6c2109fa49c48a9e4b5337348d0a) and [Lakoff 1993: Contemporary Theory of Metaphor](https://www.notion.so/Lakoff-1993-Contemporary-Theory-of-Metaphor-401f0cf483414b82a7035cbfbfbb0ffc) that cognition "is not about the lexicon or the set of its referents in the real world.... [but] about *comparisons*, beginning with the acute comparison of words with one another that we call metaphor." (See Nietzsche on the "metaphorical" removes of our perception & linguistic understanding from the thing itself, in *On Truth & Lies in a Nonmoral Sense*):

To begin with, a nerve stimulus is transferred into an image: first metaphor. The image, in turn, is imitated in a sound: second metaphor. And each time there is a complete overleaping of one sphere, right into the middle of an entirely new and different one

Later Wagner quotes Thoreau: "All perception of the truth is the detection of an analogy." 

### Felt meaningfulness is the experience of polysemy

Robert Foster on Roy Wagner:

Like metaphor (their verbal counterpart), images 'contain 'and 'elicit' all the glosses and thus lend themselves more to direct experience or revelation than to description or verbal summary. Meaning, then, as Wagner broadly contends in *Symbols That Stand For Themselves* (STSFT), is itself a perception 'elicited' by unglossable and paradoxical tropes—metaphor, analogy, image.

Sarah Perry, "Ambiguity As Meaning":

...ambiguity is the essence of meaning. Here I mean “meaning” in the sense of the profound, the artistically deep, the spiritually relevant – not in the crude sense of “pointing” that I previously examined. The story of the Garden of Eden, *The Shining*, your *Hamlet* and *Bend Sinister*, the evidence of their profundity (that is to say, ambiguity) lies in the multitude of interpretations they support.

### Good design capture polysemy via ambiguity

As she continues, on Christopher Alexander's principles of design:

I have previously written, never satisfactorily, about Christopher Alexander’s Fifteen Fundamental Properties (properties of beauty, or of wholeness, or of the profound in general). Since putting on the ambiguity lens, it’s become clear to me that every property in Alexander’s list is a method for elaborating ambiguity. Even though only one of the fifteen properties explicitly uses the word “ambiguity,” it is the organizing principle of all of them. They are ways of making the vague precisely ambiguous. Strong borders emphasize a division while themselves bridging this division. Spaces in between – the “ground” of figures – must not be vague and forgotten, but must themselves display forms with good shape, rendering the very distinction of figure and ground ambiguous but not vague. The Void is incorporated as an entity, so that there is ambiguity between presence and absence. In his architectural patterns, entrance transitions and arcades render ambiguous “inside” and “outside.”

Now see Wagner again on "reciprocity of perspectives" and "pire wuo" (above). Wagner continues:

"That," they went on to say, "is how you put *power* in art." They were referring, apparently, to techniques of colour inversion, self-inverting geometric patterning and other forms of figure-field inversion...

### The Pachamama & the Kogi

or, Plato's cave, literalized:

Take, for example, the Kogi, a group of Quechua-speaking people living in the highlands of modern Colombia. The Kogi claim they were never touched by the Spanish Conquest, and live in small, organised townships under the rule of a type of a shamanic leader called a Pachamama (‘Earth Mother’). What is of interest here is the way in which the neophyte Pachamama is raised from infancy, in a regimen that has few or no parallels elsewhere in the world. His mother gives birth to him in a deep, dark cave, and he is kept there in deep, dark seclusion for nine years. During this time, he is given no choice; he must learn all of the basic human functions, moving, walking, speaking, thinking, relating to others, perception, cognition, manipulation of things and his environment, in the complete absence of visual cues and the shared assumptions that make our world into a collective reality. Language for him is only the buzz of one word connecting to the buzz of another, a discourse of purely metaphorical values that do not know they are metaphorical values for want of concrete referents and shared assumptions. He knows a world without description, and a description without a world. Then, at the age of nine, in that magical moment when he emerges into full daylight, the whole of human artifice becomes transparent to him, and he knows the actual physical world around him as a source of infinite mystery and surprise.

## Discussion

### Suspended Reason

Wagner's "reciprocity of perspectives" resembles in key aspects the **thesis/antithesis/synthesis model** of Hegelian dialectic, the **太极 tàijí dualism** of Taoism, and the **object-level/meta-level** frame of the rationalists. In all cases, an idea of "leveling up" or "seeing from above" how two apparently opposing entities, or forces, are part of some meaningful, higher-order unity; this "aboveness" is removed from the typical "situated" view; one gains insight into one's situation via the aboveness. 

I am best of beginning with a pattern I have noticed lately in myself, in my own epistemology. A younger self holds a naive belief, say, in the virtues of rationalism, which is mostly un-interrogated. Perhaps I have some reservations about specific behavioral econ projects, but my skepticism hasn't generalized. I come across certain arguments—*Seeing Like A State*, Hayek's *Fatal Conceit*, Christopher Alexander's theories of design, Gerd Gigerenzer on behavioral economics, Taleb on risk assessment. I start understanding the brilliance of evolution, the hubris of historical human reasoning. At last, after having been thoroughly convinced, I hear a different, equally compelling case involving hill-climbing and natural selection, citing myopic view in the fog of local maxima, this idea that intelligence and reasoning can get us *over* valleys the valleys evolution "dumbly" gets stuck in. 

Similarly, I can come across functionalism, and believe they're far understating human agency with this totalizing view of norms, and then I stumble upon ethnomethodology, Garfinkel's idea of the "cultural dope," this imaginary human being Parsons must conjure to make his functionalist arguments about top-down normative control, but now there is no mention of the unconscious way that norms can shape your "social physics," your very sense of the possible, thinkable, and desirable, of the options on the table (cf. "politics is about putting things on the table that are presently off it"). The point is that both "sides" are right; you'd have to work hard to convince me there's no unconscious internalization of norms, or that there isn't a meaningful amount of leeway afforded to agents in the vast majority of institutions, even our prisons, that allow members to subvert and build norms.

How it appears to me is that each side is engaging in one of two claims: Absolutism—that the opposing side's explanation does not constitute a meaningful part of the picture, should not be included in the common map, etc—or a signal-corrective-style "summing up" dispute over which part of the picture is the dominant narrative and which is the qualifying corrective—the "except," the disclaimer, the differential.

The first frame is often but not always silly. There are certainly disputes with intelligent members of the field on either side that are legitimately dichotomous. But I increasingly believe that only a minority percentage of the overall conflicts, at least in the Inexact Sciences, which are *believed* to be or treated as (theory-in-use) dichotomous through the language, rhetoric, tactics, and strategies of either side, are, in actuality, in direct contradiction. More often they are either a verbal dispute (as previously discussed in the "Philosophers as Unwitting Lexicographers" series; examples include the disputes over the details of ideas like "meaning," "collective intentionality," "causality," "free will," and "knowledge") or else a *scope argument*: a dispute over which story (or "mechanism," or "causal driver") ought to be the dominant and which the corrective. While this dispute may be a meaningful start in instances where the alleged gap between dominant and corrective, in terms of explanatory power, is wide, in many cases I hazard that the cause of the widespread dispute among smart, well-informed individuals is a result of this gap being relatively narrow, and therefore even determining the victor of the debate would give us little insight into our world. The variance between cases is too high, and the gap too narrow, to make predictions or judgments about any specific situations—e.g. when one ought to trust one's gut or the math, whether one is acting out norms or has agency within them. These disputes may need to be re-carved for more meaningful natural lines (when one situation is relevant, or the other) to appear.

In some sense, verbal disputes and scope arguments might even be theorized to be hyponyms of a broader class: battles over discursive turf.
