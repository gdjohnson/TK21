[7:06 PM] snav: I think "layer of instrument mediation necessary to perceive the system as parts vs a whole" is a good frame for "layers" of reality
[7:06 PM] suspended reason: that's interesting
[7:06 PM] snav: so "immediate consciousness" is somewhere in the middle actually
[7:07 PM] suspended reason: now, conceptually, we bounce between layers (I can picture a system from a "birds-eye")
[7:07 PM] suspended reason: but that system isn't actually perceptible synchronously
[7:07 PM] snav: on the one hand, you have hermeneutics of suspicion, which lead you to break down consciousness into pieces, and on the other hand you have physics ontology
[7:07 PM] suspended reason: it's diachronously perceptible
[7:07 PM] snav: yes!!!
[7:08 PM] snav: You need a narrative to back physics with truth
[7:09 PM] suspended reason: like, maybe there's a hypothetical tool that can "break down the dimensions as we experience them, such that we would revel in the total view all at once," but we have no conception or possibility of it, so we instead model that kind of observation through logic & evidence-building
[7:09 PM] suspended reason: yeah hmm
[7:09 PM] suspended reason: so the tool itself is epistemology, that lets us "see" diachronously & across space or for a "category" as a whole
[7:09 PM] snav: That's the Archimedean point, the total synchronous view
[7:09 PM] suspended reason: ok I like this but I wanna test it
[7:10 PM] snav: this is good philosophy of Science tbh
[7:10 PM] suspended reason: can we come up with a short list of some "multi-layer" systems? e.g. atom --> cell --> organism or neuron --> brain --> social system?
[7:11 PM] snav: lemme find a cool pic
[7:12 PM] snav:

[7:12 PM] snav: this was John C Lilly describing the layers of "consciousness"
[7:13 PM] snav: but i think all sciences have their own systematic hierarchies that go pretty deep
[7:14 PM] snav: and we should keep in mind that some systems are rhizomatic rather than hierarchical
[7:14 PM] snav: i.e. structured in a loop rather than a line or tree
[7:14 PM] suspended reason: (unrelated sidebar that I'm sending so I don't forget: when people say something is "a thing," it seems like they mean either "this is a pattern in world" or "this is a pattern people recognize," and the 2 are very different)
[7:15 PM] suspended reason: is that consciousness layer scheme widely adopted/used?
[7:15 PM] snav: like Piaget's psychology -> mathematics -> physics -> biology -> psychology
[7:15 PM] snav: no it's considered crackpot theory lol
[7:16 PM] suspended reason: ok lol was gona say
[7:16 PM] suspended reason: hadn't seen it before
[7:16 PM] snav: but it does deeply parallel Hegel's hierarchy of consciousness
[7:16 PM] snav: which i have not read enough yet to describe
[7:17 PM] snav: i think it's cool to discover the "root" element in any schema of this sort
[7:17 PM] snav: it's special, usually
[7:17 PM] snav: as "where the faith goes"
[7:17 PM] snav: Lacan called it the "master signifier"
[7:18 PM] snav: so speaking psychologically, you'd need to prefix "atoms" with "Science" for most ppl
[7:18 PM] snav: but for others, it'd be a combination of mediated observation and mathematics
[7:18 PM] suspended reason: maybe we stay away from any areas that aren't well understood, such that we can minimize vagueness/ambiguity in the picture? I was thinking neuron --> brain --> institution, but maybe just asking what makes the "person layer" different than the "institution" layer
[7:19 PM] snav: part of the fun is finding the "weak points" tho, it reveals a lot about cultural biases
[7:19 PM] suspended reason: hmmm
[7:19 PM] suspended reason: ok what do you have to say about consciousness levels
[7:19 PM] snav: like playing the same game for "mental illness" shows several different possibilities
[7:19 PM] suspended reason: I dunno if I have anything but I do about e.g. people vs institutional layer
[7:20 PM] snav: ah i just thought it was neat lol don't have a lot of comments
[7:20 PM] snav: also gotta run for dinner
[7:23 PM] suspended reason: ok word
[7:23 PM] suspended reason: i'm gonna finish some thoughts here
[7:23 PM] suspended reason: you can see if they interest ya later tn
[7:23 PM] suspended reason: in people/institutional layering:

1. The people’s wills are to some extent subjugated to the will of the institution, not just in the sense of “physical constraints” but in the sense of more voluntary behavioral modification.
2. The people are more tightly bound-up in obligation & alliance (at least in the given domain) with each other than they are with the constituents of other institutions

[7:26 PM] suspended reason: in cell/organism layering:

1. The cell's genetic interests are aligned with and subjugated to the interest of the organism (this perfect alignment is the result of shared dna, just like ant colonies & queens)
2. The cells are more tightly bound-up with each other than they are with other "organizing" higher layers
3. There is a boundary of difference between cells and world, such that they let things pass more easily between them (but not in from the outside) and also that they are each more similar, atomically, to one another than to the outside contexts

[7:26 PM] suspended reason: any of these might be unnecessary, or they might be insufficient in entirety
[7:26 PM] suspended reason: Hmmm, okay, so in living "layers" the idea is a coordination of interest
[7:27 PM] suspended reason: All "constituents" are in it together, and there is some top-down or collective decision-making as opposed to "pure autonomy" for the constituents
[7:27 PM] suspended reason: This obviously doesn't seem to be the case for non-living "layers," and maybe it's worth dividing them up
[7:28 PM] suspended reason: Now I'm getting more bullish on SSC's "Studies on Slack"—check out these excerpts
[7:29 PM] suspended reason:

In the esoteric teachings, the inner layer of two-layer evolutionary systems is represented by the Goddess of Cancer, and outer layer by the Goddess of Everything Else. In each part of the poem, the Goddess of Cancer orders the evolving-entities to compete, but the Goddess of Everything Else recasts it as a two-layer competition where cooperation on the internal layer helps win the competition on the external layer.

[7:31 PM] suspended reason: OK, now I'm off to go read what Friston thinks about Markov blankets in the hope it levels this convo up
[7:36 PM] suspended reason: these are also good, from informational metaphysics:
[http://metaphysicist.com/problems/composition/](http://metaphysicist.com/problems/composition/)[http://metaphysicist.com/problems/identity/](http://metaphysicist.com/problems/identity/)

Mereological universalism or extensional mereology is an abstract idea, defined in 1937 by Stanislaw Leśniewski and later by Henry Leonard and Nelson Goodman (1940). It claims that any collection of things, for example the members of a set in symbolic logic, can be considered as the parts of a whole, a "fusion" or "mereological sum," and thus can compose an object. Critics of this idea says that such arbitrary collections are just "scattered objects." A mind-independent connection between objects is needed for them to be integral "parts."
[...]
Mereological nihilists, such as Peter van Inwagen and the early Peter Unger denied the existence of composites, seeing them as simples (partless entities) arranged to look like a composite object. For him, a table is "simples arranged table-wise."

[7:38 PM] suspended reason: The answer from information metaphysics is compelling, I think, and makes points echoing some of the above:

Information provides a more fundamental reason than van Inwagen's for treating living things as integrated composites and not simply mereological sums of scattered objects. Furthermore, it extends a true composite nature to artifacts and to groupings of living things because they share a teleonomic property – a purpose. And it shows how some "proper parts" of these composites can have a holistic relation with their own parts, enforcing transitivity of part/whole relations.

[4:33 PM] suspended reason: on layers
[4:33 PM] suspended reason: still needa get to markov blankets
[4:34 PM] suspended reason: oh fuk.
[4:34 PM] suspended reason:

This work addresses the autonomous organization of biological systems. It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to Home sapiens, in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.
