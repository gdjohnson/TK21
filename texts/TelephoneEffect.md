# Telephone effect

In popular discourse, related to the effect _Concepts do not convert people; people convert concepts_. In academic discourse, _a cause of scope arguments masquerading as dichotomies_.

## Examples

### Fifty words for snow

fr. Regier, Carstensen, Kemp 2016: Languages Support Efficient Communication about the Environment.

Franz Boas observed that certain Eskimo languages have unrelated forms for subtypes of snow (e.g. aput: snow on the ground, qana: falling snow), and thus subdivide the notion of snow more finely than English does [1]. He suggested that such cross-language variation in the grouping of ideas into named categories “must to a certain extent depend upon the chief interests of a people” [1]. Boas’ Eskimo example was repeated by Whorf [2], and was subsequently exaggerated through popularization, leading to grossly inflated claims about the number of words for snow in Eskimo languages. Through this exaggeration and resulting critique [3, 4], the snow example has acquired an air of unseriousness, and it tends to be avoided by many scholars. However, recent work has suggested some empirical support for the original claim prior to its distortion [5], motivating a broader re-examination across languages, and greater theoretical attention.

[6:12 PM] snav: Reich won a pyrrhic victory because he "won" the cultural war but his terms lost their intended meanings, goals distorted by societal game of telephone
[6:13 PM] snav: whereas Freud "lost" the public war but remains read and used with rather high fidelity, at least in the intellectual world
[6:13 PM] snav: Freud sort of towers over Reich tho
[6:14 PM] snav: Reich is sort of a young plucky revolutionary manifesto writer, Freud is the old wise balanced grandfather
[8:49 PM] suspended reason: "social game of telephone" is a good handle
[8:50 PM] suspended reason: I wonder if there's an even more compressed/descriptive name
[8:50 PM] suspended reason: What, we talked about this w/r/t Freud's sexuality and how it "hit" the States in the 20s, where pretty soon everyone was going around saying it was "repressive" not to be having casual sex all the time lmao
[8:51 PM] suspended reason: Chinese whispers is the british name for American "game of telephone"

[9:14 PM] suspended reason: damn, structuralism makes so much more sense as a response to garbage existentialism
[9:16 PM] suspended reason: something's coming together for me about dialectic and signals/correctives.... Plato responding to the Sophists.... an idea gets watered down (telephone) and then another side has easy prey to rip into....
[10:02 PM] suspended reason: so, if most of the movements have a core of insight but have a "dominant bent" which gets outsized and then challenged by a new dominant paradigm, what would it look like to pull em out of their dialectic form—their contingent, situated-in-opposition-to-previous-arguments form—and find a way to coordinate each group's valuable ideas instead of contrasting them?
[10:03 PM] suspended reason: I'd imagine many pragmatic e.g. sociologists and critics already do this, but

[12:18 PM] suspended reason: "small step size" of inferential distance kinda seems like what you're talking about
[12:20 PM] snav: i... think i agree with his critique, but im having trouble processing his language
[12:21 PM] snav: idk what step size means
[12:22 PM] snav: i definitely agree with the "bias in favor of 'compact' arguments" and actually i do think that's one of the main flaws
[12:23 PM] snav: compact arguments tend to require little conceptual reorientation, the result is that rats never end up interrogating ideas very deeply
[12:24 PM] snav: this is also Gabe's big issue fwiw
[12:25 PM] snav: he refuses to engage with any arguments that threaten his preexisting configuration of ideas, so if it's anything more than "compact" (i.e. relying on existing conceptual structures), he rejects it immediately
[12:26 PM] snav: i also see this a lot in the SSC comments
[12:28 PM] snav: IME rats will argue about studies and methodologies all day long but they will never get into the conceptual interrogation level we reach in this discord
[12:41 PM] suspended reason: sorry was in the shower
[12:41 PM] suspended reason: yeah his language is a bit tricky
[12:42 PM] suspended reason: FWIW, the support of Occam's razor-type explanations is a major theoretical touchstone and not just an unquestioned assumption
[12:42 PM] suspended reason: Not arguing, just trying to put all the pieces on the table for understanding
[12:43 PM] suspended reason: One takeaway Yud has from the "Linda the feminist banker" conjunction fallacy type studies is that the more specificity we add to narratives, the more compelling they seem, even as they become less probabilistically likely
[12:43 PM] suspended reason: And so a coherent complex gestalt has an inherent attraction to human beings over simpler explanations
[12:44 PM] suspended reason: He's written some unorthodox supports of Occam's razor which I haven't delved into enough to know whether they're on-point or not, but they're actually seen as one of his original contributions to discourse
[12:45 PM] suspended reason: The idea that most complex mysterious things are the results of very simple underlying dynamics & emergence is a touchstone of rationalist thinking but it's not an unwitting bias, I guess, is all I'm trying to say—it's at least a considered intellectual stance, regardless of whether it's helpful or harmful
[12:45 PM] suspended reason: Also, hmm
[12:45 PM] suspended reason: I wonder how much this is fair to ask
[12:45 PM] suspended reason: Because I get your critique of "harmful ways of thinking"
[12:46 PM] suspended reason: But I'm also wary of the telephone problem: using SSC commenters (the less-sophisticated adopters of an ideology) to critique the ideology itself is exactly what we object to w/r/t e.g. bad poststructuralism, bad Freudianism in the 20s, etc
[12:47 PM] suspended reason: so I'm trying to figure out how to meaningfully separate it—poststructuralism teaches garbage habits of mind if you're not super sophisticated about it; going around being like "everything's constructed! everything is oppression!" is arguably much worse than LessWrong rationalism
